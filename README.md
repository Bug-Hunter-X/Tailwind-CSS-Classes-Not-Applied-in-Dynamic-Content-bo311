# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied in Dynamic Content

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly when dealing with dynamically generated content or components that mount after the initial render. 

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal example of this issue.  When the application initially loads, some elements may not have the expected Tailwind styles applied. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution demonstrating the use of a suitable method (such as `@apply` directives in some cases, or ensuring that Tailwind's post-processing or hydration mechanisms work correctly), fixing the issue and ensuring that all elements display the correct Tailwind styles regardless of whether they're rendered initially or dynamically.
